# Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 First-Stage Landings with Machine Learning <br>

This project investigates the feasibility of predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings using machine learning. <br>
## Methodology:<br>
1) Data Acquisition: We collected historical launch data through web scraping techniques.<br>
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We analyzed the data to understand feature distributions and identify potential correlations with the landing success target variable. (Focuses on key aspects of EDA).<br>
3) Machine Learning Model Development: We built and hyperparameter-tuned a decision tree model to achieve optimal performance for predicting landing success.<br>
4) Model Evaluation: The tuned model achieved an accuracy of 87.68% on the training data and 83.33% on the test data.<br>

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of data science to enhance SpaceX's reusability efforts and optimize launch costs.
