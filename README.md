# SpaceX-IBM-Capstone-project
In this project, we investigated the feasibility of predicting the landing success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage boosters using machine learning <br>
We collected data on past launches from a web scraping process and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and identify potential relationships with the target variable (landing success).<br>
We built a decision tree model using a hyperparameter tuning process to achieve the best possible performance. The tuned model achieved an accuracy of 0.8768 on the training data and a test accuracy of 0.8333.<br>
Overall, this project demonstrated the potential of machine learning for predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing success. Future work can involve exploring more advanced models, incorporating additional features, and potentially deploying the model in a real-world application
